    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      We built a rasterization pipeline!
      We started from the basics, encountered many a jaggie,
      and gradually added features that finally resulted in a
      jaggie-less final output able to render shapes and textures.
      It was interesting to walk through the thought process of
      what the first computer graphics inventors thought of when
      designing the pipeline.
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

    <p>A triangle is made of 3 lines, each line splitting the plane into two halves. By
      checking that a point lies on the same side (above/below for
      clockwise/counterclockwise) of all three lines, we can determine that the point
      lies inside the triangle.</p>

    <p>Only points which fall inside the bounding box of the triangle are checked, so
      our runtime is the same as (no worse than) checking each sample in the bounding
      box.</p>

    <p><img src="./images/part1.png" alt="task1.png"></p>

    <h3 id="extra-credit-optimization">Extra Credit: Optimization</h3>
    <p>One area of the triangle rasterization algorithm that could be optimized is the
      triangle checks. Even though we&#39;re limiting the checking to the bounding box, we
      are still checking whether every single point inside the bounding box is a part
      of the triangle or not. Intuitively, we don&#39;t need to do this; we can simply
      &quot;follow the edges&quot; of the triangle, and once we&#39;ve established that, we can
      indiscriminately fill in the rest of the triangle.</p>
    <p>For the special case of a triangle that has one &quot;flat&quot; edge (parallel to the
      x-axis), and two &quot;slanted&quot; edges, this is pretty simple: we can simply loop
      through all possible y-values in the bounding box, and use the line equation to
      interpolate where that horizontal line intersects the two slanted edges. Then,
      we can simply fill in the pixels between those two points.</p>
    <p>Now, for the key part: given <em>any</em> triangle, we can always split it into two
      triangles that each have a &quot;flat&quot; edge. To split the triangles, we first sort
      the points by y-coordinate, then interpolate the middle point&#39;s y-coordinate to
      find the x-coordinate of the intersection with the other two points. This gives
      us two triangles, each with a &quot;flat&quot; edge. Then, we can use the algorithm
      described in the above paragraph to fill in the pixels for each of these two
      triangles.</p>
    <p>Attached is a picture of the optimized algorithm in action. We did this part
      very close to the deadline, so it is still a little buggy — note the random
      horizontal lines that show up occasionally — but works for the most part.</p>
    <p>Using <code>clock()</code>, we performed some simple benchmarks for the initial render.
      With the original algorithm, it took an average of 17830 clicks (0.017830
      seconds) to render the image. With the optimized algorithm, it took an average
      of 3242 clicks (0.003242 seconds) to render the image. This is a 5.5x speedup.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

    <p>First, the size of the sample buffer is adjusted based on the sampling rate
      (<code>width * height * sample_rate</code>). Next, each triangle is rasterized as normal. Finally, when resolving
      the
      frame buffer, we
      take an average of the pixels; e.g. when <code>sample_rate = 4</code>,
      <code>pixel[0] = 1/4 * (sample_buffer[0] + sample_buffer[1] + sample_buffer[2] + sample_buffer[3])</code>.

    <p>Without any supersampling (sample rate = 1), we see jaggies. As the sampling rate increases, we observe that the
      jaggies are smoothed over with a blurred effect, since the average color over the local area is used. Zoomed in,
      we
      can see the distinct gradient of red to white along the edge, but zoomed out, the edge of the triangle appears
      smooth.

    <p>We also implemented rotating the viewport. First we added additional keyboard events for &#39;Q&#39; and
      &#39;E&#39;
      to move the viewport on press. For <code>move_view</code> and <code>set_view</code> functions, we added an
      additional
      parameter <code>float rotation_deg</code>, and we apply rotation using the rotate matrix defined in
      <code>transforms.cpp</code>.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

    <p>Barycentric coordinates in a triangle are based on a point&#39;s relative distance to
      other points in the triangle. The example triangle below has vertices red, green,
      and blue. Using interpolation based on the Barycentric coordinates, we smoothly
      blend the color such that points closer to the red vertex are more red, and
      linearly decrease in red value for further points. To be more exact, we define
      values <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code> as the distance from each altitude&#39;s base
      as
      a percentage (value 0 to 1), such that <code>alpha</code> + <code>beta</code> + <code>gamma</code> = 1. Then to
      interpolate color value between points, we can simply calculate
      <code>alpha * A + beta * B + gamma * C</code> where <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> are the values
      at
      each
      vertex.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

    <p>Texture pixel sampling is how we render a texture (image) onto a surface (many
      triangles). The challenge is that the locations/coordinates of the texture
      pixels do not align exactly with the pixels we want to render on the screen.
      The most straightforward way to resolve this is nearest sampling, where the
      color value of the closest pixel in the texture coordinates is used. A better
      way is bilinear sampling, where we interpolate the color based on the 4
      closest pixels. The effects of bilinear sampling is most prominent on high
      frequency areas (quickly changing, narrow strips of color), where you can clearly
      see the smoothing effect.</p>
    <p><img src="./images/part5-nearest.png" alt="">
      <img src="./images/part5-bilinear.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>Bilinear sampling has a tendency to wash out the true color in these scenarios,
      but it &quot;defeats&quot; nearest sampling in the sense that the general shapes and
      patterns in the bilinear sampled image are closer to the original image than in
      nearest sampling, where fine-grained details can often be lost.</p>
    <p>Below images are nearest with 1 spp, nearest with 16 spp, bilinear with 1 spp,
      bilinear with 16 spp. We note that the texture sampling method affects pixels
      within the triangle while supersampling affects pixels along the edges of the
      triangle.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

    <p>Mipmaps store a texture at multiple different resolutions. Using the appropriate
      level texture when rendering reduces aliasing effects and improves efficiency.
      For example, for rendering an image minimized in screen space, using a lower
      resolution texture means the full high resolution texture does not have to be
      loaded. The approach of using the appropriate mip level texture for each triangle
      is <code>nearest</code> level sampling. However, this can create aliasing effects at the
      boundaries of mip levels.
      To smoothly transition in between level boundaries, the <code>bilinear</code> sampling method
      loads the two closest mip levels and linearly interpolating between them.
      In the bilinear sampled image, the aliasing is no
      longer visible. Of course, the tradeoff is that <code>bilinear</code> sampling uses more
      memory since it requires two mip levels to be loaded, and slower since an additional
      lerp has to be calculated. In comparison, <code>nearest</code> loads one mip and performs one
      lookup. In terms of memory usage, <code>nearest</code> would be more efficient than <code>level0</code>
      where the full resolution image is always used.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 7: Draw something interesting!</h3>
    We procedurally generated the vaporwave background (sin waves using polyline)
    and drew a texture our favorite professor, rendered in trilinear interpolation with 16 supersampling.
    The lines are jaggies because antialiasing was not implemented for lines, only triangles.
