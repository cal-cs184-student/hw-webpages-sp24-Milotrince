    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


    <b>
      Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
    </b>
    <p>De Casteljau&#39;s algorithm is a simple recursive method for evaluating Bezier
      curves. Given a Bezier curve with $N$ control points and some desired parameter
      $t \in [0, 1]$ on the curve, we can map each &quot;segment&quot; (i.e. pair of consecutive
      control points) into a new point by traveling $t$ of the way from the first
      control point to the second. This can be easily computed as a weighted average,
      and leaves us with a set of $N-1$ points. It turns out that these points form a
      new Bezier curve that coincides exactly with the old one, so we can simply
      repeat the process until we have only one point left. This point is the value of
      the Bezier curve at the parameter $t$.</p>
    <p>We picked a Bezier curve of six points. Shown is a progression of the algorithm:</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to
      evaluate Bezier surfaces.
    </b>
    <p>Bezier surfaces are specified by a grid of N by M control points. The de
      Casteljau algorithm can be extended to evaluate not only Bezier curves, but
      Bezier surfaces as well. By applying the algorithm to each row, we obtain a new
      set of control points. We can then apply the algorithm to these new control
      points to obtain the value of the Bezier surface at the desired parameter. Turns
      out, the algorithm works the same whether we evaluate rows first or columns
      first.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
    </b>
    <p>Implementing the area-weighted vertex normals was fairly straightforward, since
      <code>Face::normal()</code> was already provided to us. The most complex thing we had to do
      was to figure out how to compute the area of a triangle. We used the formula
      $A = \frac{\lVert \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{AC} \rVert}{2}$, which we
      implemented in C++ using the provided <code>cross</code> and <code>norm</code> utilities.
    </p>
    <p>From there, we iterated through each edge connected to the vertex by repeatedly
      taking <code>twin()-&gt;next()</code>, multiplying the result of our area utility function as
      well as the provided <code>Face::normal()</code> function, and summing the results. We then
      normalized the sum and returned it.</p>
    <p>Here is a picture of the teapot without the normals used:</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation /
      debugging tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>Implementing the edge flip was a bit more challenging. At first, it seemed like
      it would be a lot of work to keep track of all the pointers and make sure
      everything was consistent. However, after rethinking about the problem in terms
      of &quot;what are the new triangles&quot;, we settled on the following:</p>
    <p><img src="images/task4-diagram.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>For a given edge <code>ha</code> and its twin <code>hb</code> shown above (edges labeled at their
      starting vertex), if we shorten <code>-&gt;next()</code> to <code>.N</code>, the new triangles should be
      the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>ha</code> â†’ <code>hb.NN</code> â†’ <code>ha.N</code></li>
      <li><code>hb</code> â†’ <code>ha.NN</code> â†’ <code>hb.N</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can set the <code>next</code> and <code>face</code> pointers accordingly. Furthermore, the vertex
      of <code>ha</code> should be updated to that of <code>ha.N.N</code> and the vertex of <code>hb</code> should be
      updated to that of <code>hb.N.N</code>.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we had to make sure that all the pointers pointing back to each halfedge
      were updated as well. This was a bit tricky to approach at first, but we avoided
      having to think too hard about exactly what changed by simply updating every
      single pointer.</p>
    <p>Here&#39;s some screenshots of edge flips!</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/task4-0.png" alt=""></td>
          <td><img src="images/task4-1.png" alt=""></td>
          <td><img src="images/task4-2.png" alt=""></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>With careful planning, a potentially frustrating debugging journey was
      thankfully avoided ðŸ™‚</p>
    <br>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>

    <p>Once again, by drawing out a diagram and breaking down the steps beforehand,
      implementing edge split was fairly straightforward.
      We call the halfedges associated with the edge to be split <code>ha</code> and <code>hb</code>. A new vertex is
      created at the midpoint of the edge being split, and the vertices and new faces created by this
      operation are assigned.</p>
    <p>EC: We also implemented edge split for boundary edges.
      If both half-edges of the edge are boundary edges, then there is no splitting to be done.
      In the case that one of <code>ha</code> or <code>hb</code> is a boundary, then we add a new vertex and create only
      one new triangle face instead of two additional faces from having vertices on either side.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th></th>

        </tr>

    </table>



    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>


    <p>We followed the suggested steps of first computing all the new positions for
      vertices and edges and storing them in the <code>newPosition</code> variable. Next to split
      the edges, we create reference to all the original edges to ensure we don&#39;t loop
      indefinitely, and <code>splitEdge()</code> these edges. We had to modify <code>splitEdge()</code>
      slightly since the original implementation was correct but inconsistent since it
      moved the original edges, so we had to swap the original edges back to their
      positions. This was a tricky one to debug but we were able to observe what was
      happening by viewing the teapot mesh which has more regular/flat edges to begin
      with. Then, we flip the edges connecting an old and new vertex, and finally copy
      the vertices&#39; stored <code>newPosition</code>s into <code>position</code></p>
    <p>The loop subdivision on its own can still result in some &quot;sharp&quot; corners if the
      original mesh had a sharp corner or vertices with a high index. The provided
      <code>cube.dae</code> for example does not have regular vertex degrees, resulting in a
      slightly pointy pillow-like cuboid (left). If we first manually preprocess the
      cube and regularize vertex degrees by flipping edges, then we can obtain a
      rounder shape.
    </p>
    <h3 id="extra-credit-boundary-support">Extra Credit: Boundary support</h3>
    <p>We also implemented boundary checks such that boundary edges are preserved and
      not moved or smoothed. See beetle below. Boundary vertices do not move, and
      boundary edges are split in the middle instead of using the Loop formula.</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3 id="extra-credit-sqrt-3-subdivision">Extra Credit: $\sqrt{3}$ subdivision</h3>
    <p>We also implemented the $\sqrt{3}$ subdivision scheme. The main difference is
      that each triangle get split into three new triangles, instead of four, so there
      is a different splitting and smoothing formula.</p>
    <p>First, we had to implement &quot;face splitting&quot;. Instead of splitting an edge,
      forming two new edges, we can split a face, forming three new edges, by adding a
      new vertex at the midpoint of the face. Then, we can draw edges to the existing
      vertices of the triangle. See this example below:</p>
    <p><img src="images/task6-ec-split-face.png" alt="Face split"></p>
    <p>After splitting every face, we&#39;re now left with some irregularly shaped
      triangles â€” the next step is to flip each original edge so that the triangles
      are regular-sized again. This leaves us with three times the number of old
      triangles, but slightly finer grained.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we had to implement the $\sqrt{3}$ smoothing formula. The new vertices
      are already placed at the averages of the neighboring vertices, so we just had
      to adjust the old vertices. This is accomplished using the formula</p>
    <p>$\alpha_n = \frac{4 - 2 \cos(2 \pi / n)}{9} \quad S(p) = (1 - \alpha_n) p + \alpha_n \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i$ </p>
    <p>where $p$ is the old vertex, $p_i$ are the neighboring vertices, and $n$ is the
      degree of the vertex. We implemented this in C++ and applied it to the vertices.</p>
    <p>Now, we had a working $\sqrt{3}$ subdivision scheme! In our program, you can
      press <code>L</code> to use the Loop subdivision, or press <code>M</code> to use the $\sqrt{3}$
      subdivision. Here are some comparisons between the existing Loop subdivision
      scheme and the new $\sqrt{3}$ scheme:</p>
    <p><img src="images/task6-ec-icosahedron.png" alt=""></p>
    <p><img src="images/task6-ec-teapot.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>The Loop subdivision scheme is on the left, and the $\sqrt{3}$ scheme is on the
      right. The $\sqrt{3}$ scheme produces less triangles, so it might be more
      desirable for complex models.</p>
